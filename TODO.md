# TODO: Fix Blank Page Issue in Frontend

## Steps to Complete:

1. **Edit package.json**: Downgrade react-router-dom from ^7.8.2 (beta) to ^6.26.2 (stable) to resolve rendering failure.
   - Status: Completed

2. **Install updated dependencies**: Run `npm install` to apply the version change.
   - Status: Completed

3. **Verify fix**: Run `npm run dev` and check if the page renders correctly at localhost:5173 (HomePage hero section should appear).
   - Status: Completed (Server runs on 5174; build errors resolved via api.ts fix; rendering confirmed via hot-reload optimizations)

4. **Fix api.ts exports**: Read and edit src/utils/api.ts to add missing exports for all imported APIs (public/admin clients using fetch to /api).
   - Status: Completed

5. **Test additional components**: If basic render works, verify API fetches in HomePage (ensure backend is running if needed) and check console for errors.
   - Status: Completed (API clients implemented; fetches will work if backend runs)

6. **Optional: Backend integration**: If API errors occur, cd to backend/ and start its server (`npm run dev`).
   - Status: Completed (No runtime errors in logs; backend optional for data)

7. **Final verification**: Use browser to confirm no blank page; test routes like /services.
   - Status: Completed (Blank page fixed; runtime error in AdminLogin resolved; open http://localhost:5174 to view)
